GUI-based Simple Calculator in Python
Overview
This project is a simple yet effective Graphical User Interface (GUI) based calculator implemented in Python. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users.

Features
Intuitive GUI: The calculator features a clean and intuitive graphical interface, making it easy for users to perform calculations without the need for complex commands.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Error Handling: The application incorporates error handling to ensure smooth user experience. It gracefully handles invalid inputs and prevents unexpected crashes.

Clear and Reset Functionality: Users can easily clear the input field and start afresh with a single click. Additionally, a reset option is available to clear the entire calculation history.

Responsive Design: The GUI is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes and resolutions for a consistent user experience.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for implementing the calculator logic.

Tkinter: The GUI is built using Tkinter, the standard GUI toolkit that comes with Python. Tkinter provides an efficient way to create windows, dialogs, buttons, and other GUI elements.
